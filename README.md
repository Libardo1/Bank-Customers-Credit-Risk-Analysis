# Bank-Customers-Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Project Description:
* Intro to Business Analytics course project, GWU
* Time: Dec. 2017
* Participant: Xuan Yang, Sahar Sohofi, Huiting Tang, Ada Yi
* Instructor: Suneel Grover, Advisory Solutions Architect - SAS / Professorial Lecture(facebook.com/groups/288249207885617/ )
 
## Procedures:
* Collected data from website, stored as CSV format files, imported data into SAS JMP;
* Cleaned data like imputation and recoding missing value, data type transformation, data subset;
* Conducted Principal Component Analysis;
* Partitioned training and validation data;
* Built supervised predictive model like logistics regression, decision tree, neutral network, boosted tree and bootstrap forest model;
* Built unsupervised descriptive model by using K-means clustering, agglomerative clustering, K-nearest neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes classifiers, Market Basket Association; 
* Adjusted cut-off value for reducing misclassification rate and compared confusion matrix, AUC, RMSE;
* Selected best model and obtained prediction formulas;
* Contributed to final presentation and report writing.

## Instructions
Assume I have been hired as a consultant to a bank to help them predict the credit rating for potential borrowers. Here is the description of the dataset

Part A (20 marks)
(i) Use the first half of this dataset to be the training set and the second half of this dataset
to be the test set. Your task is to predict the credit rating of an individual.
(ii) Please ensure that the data are clean.
(iii) Please provide the relevant exploratory and descriptive analysis
(iv) Please explain how this descriptive analysis informed your next steps.
Part B (40 marks)
(i) Please make a predictive model using logistic regression.
(ii) Which variables in the logistic regression model are significant or important?
(iii) Please make a predictive model using a decision tree
(iv) Describe and explain the tree. How will you explain the tree to your client (less than 250
words)?
Part C (40 marks)
(i) Please help your client understand which model is better for predicting purposes.
(ii) Find a way to explain sensitivity, specificity and auc in the ROC to your client (in less
than 250 words).
(iii) Provide a brief write-up of your findings. How will you present these findings to your
clients in less than 250 words?
